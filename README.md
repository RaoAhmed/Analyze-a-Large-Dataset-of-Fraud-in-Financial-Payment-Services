# Analyze-a-Large-Dataset-of-Fraud-in-Financial-Payment-Services
Study a Vast Data Set Detailing Fraudulent Behavior in Payment Services.

## Overview
Using the Pandas library, I learned how to explore and make sense of a dataset. In the process, I wrote queries and then visualized those queries in an easily digestible format that is presentable to management.

## Background Info
The dataset has five types of transactions:

1. **CASH-IN** is any deposit.
2. **CASH-OUT** is any withdrawal.
3. **DEBIT** is a specific type of withdrawal in which the money is sent to the user’s bank account.
4. **PAYMENT** is the purchase of goods or services.
5. **TRANSFER** involves moving money from one user’s account to another user’s account.

You will also see two fields related to fraud tagging. **IsFlaggedFraud** is fraud detected by their automation system while **IsFraud** is fraud that truly occurred.

## Purpose
Being able to query and visualize large datasets helps provide critical information for which areas need additional investment. This is not limited to financial systems but internal computer information systems as well.
